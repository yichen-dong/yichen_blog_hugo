      <description>Key Takeaway I want to share some of my findings from reading &amp;ldquo;Causal Inference: The Mixtape&amp;rdquo;. The biggest of which is that if you include the wrong variables, the entire coefficient direction could be flipped (going from negative to positive). This means we need to take extra care when trying to make decisions based off of data, especially if we&amp;rsquo;re not sure if we&amp;rsquo;ve included colliders.
Background For this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on some of my findings from reading Chapter 3 of &amp;ldquo;Causal Inference: The Mixtape&amp;rdquo;, which can be found here: https://mixtape.</description>

      <description>When it came time to revamp my personal site, yichendong.com, I faced a bit of a problem. My old platform, fastpages, wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported anymore, and honestly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how the website worked. So, I decided it was time for a fresh start.
Choosing the Right Platform I weighed my options: Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll. Each had its strengths, but I initially leaned towards Jekyll for its established presence and GitHub&amp;rsquo;s seamless support.</description>
